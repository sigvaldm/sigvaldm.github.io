title: About me
---

I am particularly intersted in the interplay between computer science and mathematics, and am currently using this to complete a PhD in physics where I study the ionospheric charging of spacecrafts through the finite element method and parallel particle-in-cell supercomputer simulations. I am also interested in electronics engineering, in which I have a master's degree, and two years of working experience. At last but not least, I have been programming and picking apart computers since I was about ten.

Perhaps my main strengths are attention to details, and technical creativity. It has also been said of me (independently, by three former employers/supervisors) that I do well in both theory and practice. I enjoy working amongst enthusiastic collegues with similar interests, though I find that I perform my best when at least one of my collaborators have complementary qualities.

I am passionate about, amongst others, sustainable resource usage (as opposed to mass consumerism), effective charity, free code and free literature. In my sparetime I run and hike (and more programming, of course).

I expect future employers to have well-functioning and enthusiastic teams of competent individuals and a relaxed social atmosphere. I also try to be conscious about the impact my work has on society and natural resources and prefer a job whose net impact is positive.
